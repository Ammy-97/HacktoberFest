	<h1>MODERN WAYS TO SAVE ELECTRICITY</h1>
</div>
<div class="transbox2">
	<ol class="left">
		<li>Use Smart Power Strips:</li>
		 <ul>
		 	<li>“Phantom loads,” or the electricity used by electronics when they are turned off or in standby mode, are a major source of energy waste. In fact, it is estimated that 75% of the energy used to power office electronics is consumed when they are switched off. Advanced power strips, eliminate the problem of phantom loads by shutting off the power to electronics when they are not in use. Smart power strips can be set to turn off at an assigned time, during a period of inactivity, through remote switches, or based on the status of a “master” device.</li>
		 </ul>
		<li>Install a Programmable or Smart Thermostat:</li>
		 <ul>
		 	<li>A programmable or can be set to automatically turn off or reduce heating and cooling during the times when you are working or away. When you install a programmable thermostat, you eliminate wasteful energy use from heating and cooling without upgrading your HVAC system. Additional features of programmable thermostats can include indicators for when to replace air filters or HVAC system problems, which also improve the efficiency of your heating and cooling system.
</li>
		 </ul>
		 <li>Use Surge Protectors so you don’t drain energy from your device chargers</li>
		 <ul>
		 	<li>If your phone charger is plugged in, it’s using electricity – even when it’s not charging your phone. To avoid wasting energy, plug your phone, laptop, and other device chargers into a surge protector that can be switched off when not in use. When you’re not charging anymore, unplug all of your devices with the flick of a switch. 
</li>
		 </ul>
  <li><b>IOT BASED ENERGY MANAGEMENT IN ATM’s:</b><p>The real-time energy management uses smart micro grids with RES and energy storages. Some algorithms are used for efficient energy management. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) methods will solve the problem in distributed fashion. Micro grids have much smaller financial commitments. It uses renewable resources which is more eco-friendly with lower carbon footprints. They require very less technical support to work and depend more on automation. It is isolated from any grid disturbance or outage. The main problems that are experienced are disturbances in grid and outages that are felt by users along with frequency change, voltage fluctuations which affects the performance and life of equipment. The resulting capacity has to match the load, which increases the investment cost than estimated. 
</p></li>
<ul>
	<li>Air conditioners and its running schedules can be controlled remotely through web</li>
	<li>Energy theft can be monitored.</li>
	<li>Asset information can also be monitored (light, camera, AC and others).</li>
	<li>Light control on signage board. </li>
